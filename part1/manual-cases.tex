\section{Document Description}

This document describes some manually generated test cases for testing
Moodle.

I have concentrated on these pages:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Add new user page
  \item Edit user profile page
  \item Edit password page
\end{itemize}

Tests that validate data entry conditions are the main theme in this document.

Test identifiers are organised as follows:

\begin{description}
  \item[DENU] Data entry (for) new user page
  \item[DEEU] Data entry (for) edit user page
\end{description}

Identifiers end with \emph{S} for success cases or \emph{F} for
failure/negative cases.

I chose to concentrate on negative test cases because they are easiest
to test. Usually an input validation error results in an error message,
which would be simple to search for and verify using an automated
testing tool like Selenium.
