\section{Description of Seeded Faults}

The seeded faults concentrated on testing the tests concerning
input validation. These tests provided some invalid input
and then checked that certain errors were present or absent from the page.

I seeded faults by changing the content of some error messages.

\section{Catching faults}

My tests performed well in catching these trivial faults. They provided
detailed error messages and could potentially be used to pinpoint the source
of an error.

\section{Deficiencies in the tests}

Seeding simple faults based on error message content highlighted a certain
brittleness to my tests. For example, if the error messages legitimately changed,
they would also have to be changed in the test. Perhaps, the tests could be
improved by sourcing the error messages directly to the PHP code that declares them.

\section{Seeded faults}

The seeded faults are simply erroneous words in the error messages.

\section{Test Output}

The test output appeared to have caught these changes.
The error messages are useful, but it could be made more useful if the seeded validation error messages
were also displayed.
